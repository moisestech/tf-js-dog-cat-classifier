# HOW-TO

## **1.** Install dependencies

## **2.** Layout the state machine

- **States:**
  - 6 stages that our app can be in, each of which can have specific characteristics: (e.g. showing and image). Our app, at any given moment, can only occupy one state.

- **Transitions:**
  - Events that can trigger our app to move from one state to another. Thankfully, our simple app only needs one event, `next`.
  - Each stateâ€™s `on.next` value is the name of the state that the app will transition to whenever the `next` event is fired while the app is in that state.

## **3.** Add Functionality

---

## NPM

1. **Run App** `npm start`
2. Webpack Hot Reloading and ./dist directory bundling.

### npm start

- **scripts**: `npm start` runs scripts: `{ "start": "webpack serve"}`,
  - webpack commmands are stored in package.json#scripts
  - alternatively run `npx webpack` or `node_modules/./bin/webpack`

## Package.JSON

### Packaging App

- **scripts**: `npm start` runs scripts: { "start": "webpack serve"},
- **main**: `webpack.config.js` is where webpack starts bundling from.
